5-stage Pipeline Processor
======
* Designed a 5 stage pipelined-processor (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access and Write Back) which contains 16 32-bits width register and an instruction set of width 16-bits

In-Memory Boolean Computations in CMOS SRAM
======
* Enabled In-Memory Boolean Computations along with usual memory operations with augmented version of the conventional 8T and 8+T SRAM bit-cells, called X-SRAM

6-T and 8-T SRAM Cell Memory Arrays
======
* Designed layout of 4x4 Memory Arrays using 6-T and 8-T SRAM Cells in Cadence Virtuoso and performed DRC, LVS and PEX

Elevator Controller
======
* Coded an elevator in Verilog and studied the functionality in Xilinx Vivado

Synchronous FIFO
======
* Implemented a parameterized synthesizable synchronous FIFO in Verilog with read and write control in Xilinx Vivado

Noise Cancelling FIR Filter
======
* Designed a noise cancelling direct and transpose form FIR Filter using LMS Algorithm in VHDL in Xilinx Vivado

Study and implementation of Robust Clock Networks
======
* Simulated both un-buffered and buffered robust clock networks in sub-threshold and threshold regimes in Cadence Virtuoso UMC 65nm technology node

Bandgap Reference Circuit (schematic to layout)
======
* Implemented Op-Amp based Beta - multiplier BGR Circuit in 180nm technology node using Cadence Virtuoso

Industrial Automation
======
* Implemented multi-sensor based hardware of Industrial Automation using Arduino Uno and various sensors like Ultrasonic, IR, Moisture, Temperature Sensor and LDR
