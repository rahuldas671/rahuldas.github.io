2-stage Pipeline Processor
======
* Designed a 2 stage pipelined-processor (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access and Write Back) which contains 16 32-bits width register and an instruction set of width 16-bits

In-Memory Boolean Computations in CMOS SRAM
======
* Enabled In-Memory Boolean Computations along with usual memory operations with augmented version of the conventional 8T and 8+T SRAM bit-cells, called X-SRAM

6-T and 8-T SRAM Cell Memory Arrays
======
* Designed layout of 4x4 Memory Arrays using 6-T and 8-T SRAM Cells in Cadence Virtuoso and performed DRC, LVS and PEX

3x3 NOC Router
======
* Coded an Arbiter FIFO and various Module of NOC Router in Verilog and studied the functionality in Xilinx Vivado

Synchronous FIFO
======
* Implemented a parameterized synthesizable synchronous FIFO in Verilog with read and write control in Xilinx Vivado

Current Mirror based Band-gap Reference Circuit Design
======
* A first order Current Mirror based BGR was designed using 0.18umCMOS  technology  with  a  supply  voltage  of  1.8V  to  achieve  a  pre-cise output voltage     reference of 1.12V at 27◦C room temperature andachieve 0.2ppm/◦C of low temperature coefficient with temperaturerange of -40◦C to 125◦C.

High Impedance Current Mirror Design
======
* Designed a circuit that offered a very high impedance due to the pres-ence of the PMOS at both legs since no auxiliary biasing circuit wasused. It can be used     for applications which operate with very low current.

Single  stage  Folded-cascode  Opamp  design  with  the  single  ended output
======
* Designed a single ended folded cascode opamp with VDD= 1.8V, Gain= 92dB, CMRR = 100dB, ICMR = 0.2-0.4V, Voltage Swing = 0.5V,PSRR+ = 80dB, PSRR- = 80dB, Power =   20uW, and GBW = 1MHz.Design was carried out in SCL 180nm Technology Node

Gm-Cc Low Pass Filter Design
======
* Designed a single ended folded cascode opamp with VDD= 1.8V, Gain= 92dB, CMRR = 100dB, ICMR = 0.2-0.4V, Voltage Swing = 0.5V,PSRR+ = 80dB, PSRR- = 80dB, Power = 20uW, and GBW = 1MHz.Design was carried out inSCL 180nmTechnology Node.
