Problem Statement
======
* Developing a novel silicon based BICMOS process for Bipolar Junction Transistor having very few additional simple process steps along with CMOS fabrication
* Process is having polysilicon based emitter and extrinsic base contact
* Main focus of this process is to develop a transitor which should have better figure of merits such unity current and power gain frequencies and also better breakdown   voltage and Early voltage suitable for Radio Frequency application
